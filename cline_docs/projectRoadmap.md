# Alice in Hyperfy Wonderland - Project Roadmap

## Project Goals

- [x] Create a framework to connect an AI agent to Hyperfy
- [x] Implement an Alice in Wonderland themed personality
- [x] Develop an architecture that supports agent behaviors, avatar control, and interaction
- [x] Provide documentation for future development and extensions
- [ ] Create a backend AI service for more advanced interactions
- [ ] Implement physics-based interactions in the Hyperfy environment
- [ ] Add voice synthesis for Alice's speech

## Key Features

### Core Features
- [x] WebSocket connection to Hyperfy
- [x] Avatar loading and display 
- [x] Basic movement and navigation
- [x] Chat message handling
- [x] Character configuration system
- [x] Alice personality implementation

### Enhanced Interaction
- [x] Proximity detection for nearby players
- [x] Dynamic greeting behaviors
- [x] Idle animations and behaviors
- [ ] Contextual responses based on environment
- [ ] Memory of past interactions with users

### Technical Infrastructure
- [x] Modular architecture for extensions
- [x] Configuration via environment variables
- [x] Docker deployment support
- [ ] Multi-model AI backend integration
- [ ] Performance optimization for larger worlds

## Completion Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:

1. Alice can connect to a running Hyperfy instance without errors
2. Players can interact with Alice through chat
3. Alice responds with contextually appropriate Wonderland-themed responses
4. Alice exhibits autonomous behaviors when idle
5. The system is well-documented for future development

## Future Directions

### Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence
- Implement backend AI service with context retention
- Add multi-model routing for specialized responses
- Create skills system for specific interaction domains

### Phase 3: Environmental Awareness
- Add object and scene understanding
- Implement pathfinding for more natural movement
- Create interactions with world objects

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Support
- Allow multiple themed characters to exist simultaneously
- Enable character-to-character interactions
- Create shared context between agents

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up Hyperfy development environment
- [x] Create custom AgentLoader for avatar display
- [x] Implement AgentControls for movement
- [x] Design Alice character configuration 
- [x] Create core AliceAgent class with behaviors
- [x] Add WebSocket connection handling
- [x] Implement proximity detection
- [x] Create hyperfy-connector for integration
- [x] Add Docker configuration for deployment
- [x] Write technical documentation
