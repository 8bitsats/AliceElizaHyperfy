# Current Task: Hyperfy-Alice Integration

## Current Objectives

1. **Complete the Alice-Hyperfy integration** - Connect the Alice agent personality with the Hyperfy 3D environment.
2. **Test the integration** - Ensure Alice can connect to Hyperfy and interact with other users.
3. **Prepare for future enhancements** - Document the architecture and create a roadmap for future development.

## Context

The Alice in Hyperfy Wonderland project aims to create an interactive AI agent with an Alice in Wonderland personality inside the Hyperfy 3D environment. This requires:

1. Connecting to Hyperfy's node client API
2. Loading a custom avatar for Alice
3. Implementing Alice's personality and behaviors
4. Creating proximity detection for player interactions
5. Setting up a flexible configuration system

We've completed the core integration components:
- AgentLoader.js - For loading avatar models
- AgentControls.js - For movement and interaction
- AliceAgent.mjs - For Alice's behaviors and personality
- hyperfy-connector.mjs - The main integration layer

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Connect to AI Backend** - Implement the AI backend connection functionality
   - Create the Python AI backend with either OpenAI or Anthropic APIs
   - Add WebSocket server for communication with Alice agent
   - Implement dynamic response generation based on Alice's character

2. **Add Voice Capability** - Integrate text-to-speech for voice interactions
   - Integrate with ElevenLabs or similar service
   - Implement audio streaming through Hyperfy
   - Add mouth animation synchronization

3. **Enhance Proximity Behavior** - Improve Alice's reactions to nearby players
   - Implement more varied greeting responses
   - Add "memory" of previous encounters with specific players
   - Create more natural movement patterns around players

### Technical Improvements
1. Optimize avatar loading and animations
2. Add error handling and reconnection logic
3. Implement logging for debugging purposes
4. Create configuration UI for Alice's behavior parameters

### Documentation Updates
1. Add backend deployment instructions
2. Create troubleshooting guide
3. Document API endpoints for agent-backend communication
